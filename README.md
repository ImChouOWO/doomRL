# Play doom by Deep Learning 

This project is based on the DQN algorithm and attempts to use this model to play Doom.  

這項專案是透過DQN來遊玩DOOM。  

## SET UP
### Develop by
`python3.11.1` `torch` `gym`  

`numpy` `matplotlib` `opencv-python`  

`vizdoom`

#### clone this project
```
git clone https://github.com/ImChouOWO/doomRL.git
```
#### Necessary model (必要模組)

```
pip install torch
pip install gym
pip install numpy
pip install matplotlib
pip install opencv-python
pip install vizdoom
```

#### Run Script
```
cd ./doomRL
```
```
python3 dqn.py
```
###### If you want to test the game, you can view the complete code for the game's settings in this script.
```
python3 main.py
```
